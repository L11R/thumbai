## News

* [v1.0.0-beta](https://github.com/thumbai/thumbai/releases/latest) Initial public beta release on Dec 10, 2018.

## Features 

Provides an ability to have your own- 

* Go Modules Respository - for organization/individual, never loose dependency libraries.
* Go Vanity Service - Decouple SCM repository path from Go import path.
* Simple Proxy Server - Hosted applications on the same box then simply proxy it behind.

Every feature is on-demand and could be used individually. All THUMBAI features fully utilized by `aahframework.org`, `aahframe.work` and also THUMBAI proxy replaced my nginx proxy server.
